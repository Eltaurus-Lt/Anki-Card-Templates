# Anki Card Templates

## Memrise

This template emulates the Memrise interface for Anki cards. The functionality includes **typing-in** and **multiple-choice** questions, **automatic answer grading** with the **info screen** on failed cards, **images** and **audio** as questions (with animated buttons), **on-screen keyboard** and the **hint button**. It works on **desktop** as well as in **mobile app***:

This template does not use any of the original Memrise code and instead is written from scratch with only references to such things as measurements, colors, and fonts. It is designed to have the simplest possible HTML code in order to facilitate further [customization](#Customization). This also helps avoid many visual bugs present in the original Memrise layout:

There is also an [interactive online demo](https://codepen.io/Eltaurus/full/mdaMQby) to get a first-hand impression of the functionality without downloading anything.

### 💡 Quick start

>---  
>1. Open `Memrise Templates (Lτ) v3.32.apkg` with Anki
>2. Use `Memrise (Lτ) Preset [Translation+Listenting | Typing+MultipleChoice] v3.32` Note Type when making new cards, or [importing courses from Memrise](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/CourseDump2022?tab=readme-ov-file#importing-into-anki)
>
>Enabling Multiple-Choice cards (Optional):
>
>3. Instal the support addon in desktop Anki:
     `Tools` → `Add-ons` → `Get Add-ons` → Paste "884199977" → `Ok` → Restart Anki
>4. Open **`Browse`** window → Select Cards in the table -> Right Click 🖱️ → `Fill Choices` → `Ok`
>5. To make Multiple-Choice cards available in the app: **`Sync`** in Anki desktop → **`Sync`** in AnkiDroid
>---

### Customization

🚧
The main file is `Memrise Templates (Lτ) v2.3.apkg`. Opening it with Anki adds `Memrise Templates (Lτ) v2.3` Note Type, which can then be used to create new cards, change Note Type of existing ones, or import external spreadsheets.
<br><sub>Both, the deck and the single card in it, which are imported with the Note Type, serve only as its holders and can be deleted right away.</sub>

### Updating

If you have cards in your collection, that are using an older version of the template, and you want to upgrade them to the latest one, after downloading and importing the current `.akpg` deck follow these steps:

1. In your Anki open the Browser by clicking on `Browse` button in the top center menu
2. In the left tab scroll down and open the `Note Types` category
3. Click on the older version of `Memrise Template (Lτ) ...` you were using before
4. Click on any of the cards displayed in the table, then press `Ctrl + A` to select all of them
5. In the top menu go to `Notes` -> `Change Note Type`
6. In the top right dialog of Notetype conversion select the new version of the Notetype
7. Check the mapping of the Current fields to the New ones (if you didn't change anything in your template, all names should be the same on both sides)
8. Press `Save`

<sub>Same steps can be taken to convert existing cards from any other Note Type to this Memrise Template</sub>

### Extra

The template can be downloaded either from this page or from [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/510199145)

The template can be used for Memrise courses imported into Anki with [this extension](https://github.com/Eltaurus-Lt/CourseDump2022)
